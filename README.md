Before running the analysis, `churn_script_logging_and_tests.py` is used to test whether the main script functions work correctly and without errors. `churn_library.py` is the main script responsible for running the dataset and feature engineering as well as training the best model and saving it.

To run `churn_script_logging_and_tests.py` script use the following command line:
